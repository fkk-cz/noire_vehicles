I know this was just added and I hate to ask, but since the vehicle is 58k would it be possible to increase the acceleration portion of the vehicle? Fully tuned up it takes 
a minute to get to top speed of like 85? If its ok would it be possible to have it similair in power to the 62 Continental Sedan? If not its ok, still love the ride just
wanted a little more speed for traveling purposes! Thanks !
